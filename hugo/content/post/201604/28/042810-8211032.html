<p>擇校從來都不是一件容易事兒，尤其是在美國有 4000 多所不同的院校供你選擇。每個人都會根據什麼對自己最重要來作出自己的選擇。不管是讀研究生還是其他學位，你都需要在充分了解信息的基礎上作出選擇。</p>
<p>我在美國使館負責的一個項目是《學在美國》（EducationUSA）。該項目由美國政府支持，在美國中學畢業之後的教育機會方面提供最爲全面、及時和準確的信息。在中國，我們在北京、上海、成都、廣州和瀋陽都設有辦公室，並配有留學顧問，免費幫助學生和家長了解如何自己請學校。不久前我曾寫過一篇觀點文章，解釋爲什麼我認爲自己動手(DIY)是做一名成功的美國學生的第一步。（鏈接: <a href="http://edu.sina.com.cn/a/2016-03-22/doc-ifxqnskh1115426.shtml">http://edu.sina.com.cn/a/2016-03-22/doc-ifxqnskh1115426.shtml</a> ）我們建議學生用 DIY 的方法來申請。EducationUSA 的顧問們不尋求從學生或美國各大院校身上獲利，所以可以爲學生提供完全不含偏見的信息。我們努力幫助人們均衡地瞭解關於考試、申請程序、不同院校類型、簽證程序、助學金機會，以及不同專業的信息。任何人想要了解我們提供的各種服務，都可以訪問我們的網站<a href="http://www.educationusachina.com/">http://www.educationusachina.com/</a>。</p>
<p>在申請研究生項目時，應當考慮學校的聲譽、項目聲譽、學校位置、學校大小、師生比例、你的收入水平、成本（學費和生活成本）、你的競爭力、畢業生就業和其他因素。</p>
<p>我在申請傳播學研究生，看各個院校的時候，聽從了我的本科教學輔導員的建議，瞭解了哪些學校的傳播項目比較有實力。這也是讓我獲得有說服力的推薦信的好辦法，因爲我的教授們在傳播學領域都很有名望，而他們對我也十分了解。我記得我的輔導員推薦的學校中，有一個在堪薩斯州，但我不想在那裏生活，即便那個研究生項目很有名。另外我想選一個小一些的項目，所以最後我選擇了北卡羅來納州的維克森林大學（Wake Forest University）。那所大學離我家更近，而且給我全額獎學金，外加生活津貼，我還可以給本科生授課，這樣我就不用揹負學生貸款了。同時他們只招 8 名學生，因此每名學生都會獲得教授的很多關注。所以就我個人經驗而言，我重點考慮了地理位置、項目的聲譽和成本。直到後來我決定調整方向，重點研究國際問題的時候，我才決定去耶魯讀國際關係碩士。做這個決定時，我考慮了不同大學提供的不同項目以及課程要求。我想要一個靈活性較強的項目（在耶魯大學，只有少量學科是核心必修課，其餘學分可以由每位學生自己決定，以便發展他們的專業領域。因此，如果一名學生想要專攻歷史學，那麼他就可以修更多的歷史學課程。如果他們想做更多環境相關的工作，就要修更多環境學院的課程）。就我的個人興趣來講，其他學校的項目數目過於繁多，或者過於結構化。很幸運，我得到一筆獎學金來支付學費，這樣就不需要揹負太多的學生貸款。耶魯的國際關係研究生並不是那麼有名，所以申請時我主要看中的是它靈活多變的課程設置和這所大學的名望。</p>
<p>僅僅依靠排名來尋找和決定最適合你的項目並不是個好辦法。排名本身是根據一系列不同標準作出的，因此同一所學校在不同排名機構的排名榜上位置可能會不同。最適合你的學校可能和最適合其他人的完全不同。想想你想住在哪裏，以及你在學習期間和畢業以後都能獲得什麼樣的支持。你能在那個項目中脫穎而出嗎？那所學校的校友網絡有多活躍，是否能幫助你在畢業後邁出下一步？做出決定前花點時間衡量一下所有你最看重的事項，然後就去美國留學，享受生活吧！</p>
<p>Choosing a school is never easy, especially with over 4,000 different institutions in the U.S. from which to pick. Every choice is an individual one based on your own priorities. Whether you are going for a Masters or other degree, it will require you to make informed choices.</p>
<p>One program I am responsible for at the U.S. Embassy is the EducationUSA program. This program is supported by the U.S. government to provide the most comprehensive, current, and accurate information about opportunities to study at post secondary institutions in the United States. In China, we have offices and advisers in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shenyang whose job is to help students and parents to figure out how to apply on their own and they don&rsquo;t charge fees. I wrote an op-ed not long ago to try to explain why I think the first step to success as a student in America is through the DIY process <a href="http://edu.sina.com.cn/a/2016-03-22/doc-ifxqnskh1115426.shtml">http://edu.sina.com.cn/a/2016-03-22/doc-ifxqnskh1115426.shtml</a>. We recommend that students use the do-it-yourself method to apply. The EducationUSA advisers can give students totally unbiased information because they aren&rsquo;t looking to make a profit from the students or the U.S. institutions. We try to give people a balanced understanding of the tests, application process, different institution types, visa process, financing opportunities, and different majors. If anyone is interested in more information about the kinds of services that we provide, please check out our website at <a href="http://www.educationusachina.com/">http://www.educationusachina.com/</a>.</p>
<p>When you are looking at Masters programs, you should consider the school&rsquo;s reputation, the program&rsquo;s reputation, the location of the school, the size of the school, the student to teacher ratio, the size of your incoming class, costs (both tuition and cost of living), your competitiveness, where graduates from the program end up, among other issues.</p>
<p>When I started looking for universities that offered a Masters in Communications, I took the recommendation of my undergraduate academic advisers to know which school had strong programs in the field of communication studies. It was also a good way for me to get strong recommendation letters because my professors were well-respected in the field and knew me well. I remember one of the schools my adviser recommended was in Kansas, but I didn&rsquo;t want to live in Kansas even though the program had a good reputation. I also wanted a smaller program, so I decided to go to Wake Forest University in North Carolina. The institution was closer to home and they offered me a &ldquo;full ride&rdquo; (full scholarship), plus a living stipend and I would get to teach undergraduates. I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t incur any debts and they only accepted about eight students, so we each got a lot of attention from our professors. So in my personal experience, I weighed location, program reputation, and cost as very important. It was later when I decided to change focus and do more with international issues that I decided to get a Masters in International Relations at Yale. For that decision, I looked at the different kinds of programs offered by different universities and the course requirements. I wanted a program that was flexible (at Yale there were only a few core required classes, and the remainder of the credits could be decided by each student to develop their own areas of expertise. So if a student wanted to focus on history, they would take more history courses. If they wanted to do more related to the environment, they would take more courses in that department.) Other university programs were too quantitative or too structured for my personal interests. And luckily, I received a scholarship to cover tuition, so I didn&rsquo;t incur a lot of student debt. In that case, I ranked the flexible curriculum and the institution&rsquo;s reputation highly, since the international relations program was not as well known.</p>
<p>Making decisions purely on rankings is not a good way to find your best fit. The rankings themselves are based on a variety of criteria and so a school&rsquo;s rank may differ according to who is doing the calculation. The best institution for you might be very different from someone else. Think about where you want to live and what kind of support you will receive, both during your studies and after you graduate. Will you stand out in your program? How active is their alumni network and can they help you to take the next step after graduation? Take time to weigh all your priorities before making your decision, and then go to the U.S. and enjoy yourself!</p>
