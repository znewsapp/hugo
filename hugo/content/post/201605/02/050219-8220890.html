<div class="question">
<h2 class="question-title">身爲美國外交官，是一種怎樣的體驗？</h2>

<div class="answer">



<div class="content">
<p>在我 11 年前成爲一名外交官前，我想象它會很像好萊塢電影中描述的那樣 - 我必須穿着晚禮服，不停地出席各種招待會 / 雞尾酒會。幸運的是，事情不是這樣的。事實上，美國外交官的日常工作比好萊塢電影所描繪的更加有趣。最重要的是，它是一種可以讓你帶上自己家人的職業，這對我個人而言非常重要。我和我的妻子有五個孩子，三個女兒和兩個兒子，我們在海外撫養我們的孩子時，一起經歷了很多新奇體驗。一直以來，我們有幸在三個非常不同的國家生活和工作 - 烏克蘭、尼加拉瓜和中國。</p>
<p>我的第一項工作或外交崗位是在烏克蘭的基輔，我在那裏擔任了兩年的領事官員。我大部分時間在非移民簽證處工作，也有機會爲移民簽證團隊工作。做簽證工作相當辛苦。在基輔的工作負荷比我在北京的領事同事要小得多，但在一天 8 小時用俄語、烏克蘭語和英語進行完一個接一個的簽證面談後，我就累得做不了什麼其他事了。領事工作向我打開了瞭解另一個國家的窗口，我每天都會面談農民、表演者、學生、商人、政府官員和美國公民的烏克蘭親屬。我最喜歡的經歷包括走訪烏克蘭的城市，舉辦新聞發佈會，討論簽證和廣受歡迎的簽證抽籤項目，然後是訪問大學或當地博物館和品嚐當地美食。或許，我當領事官最傳奇的時刻是向準備嫁給阿拉斯加北極城的 Santa Claus 先生的一名烏克蘭婦女頒發移民簽證。我們這個有着三個年幼孩子的家庭享受我們的假期，我們去過克里米亞的海灘、烏克蘭西部的城堡，或在漫長的冬季一起滑雪。</p>
<p>我的第二個職位是在駐尼加拉瓜馬那瓜的使館擔任人權官員和勞工隨員。這項工作與領事工作完全不同。我的工作包括與尼加拉瓜工會領袖、尼加拉瓜大西洋沿岸的土著領袖、政界人士、民間社會團體和非政府組織會面。因爲尼加拉瓜是一個發展中國家，是西半球僅次於海地的第二貧窮國家，四處旅行不容易，特別是在大西洋海岸。有一次旅行，我不得不乘坐一條 ponga 船（這是一種小拖船，專爲沿尼加拉瓜海岸線的瀉湖設計）在顛簸的海浪上航行到一個偏遠的村莊與領導人會面，然後再趕兩個小時的路回到港口城市布盧菲爾茲。我遇到過很多勇敢的尼加拉瓜人，他們愛自己的國家，想把它變得更好。我們搬到尼加拉瓜時，也帶上了剛出生不久的兒子，我們帶他去海灘或游泳池避暑，這些都是難忘的回憶。</p>
<p>在尼加拉瓜之後，我被派往中國北京。但首先，我需要學兩年中文！第一年的中文學習是在華盛頓 DC 的美國國外勤務學院進行，第二年是在北京。作爲一名成年人，學習這樣一門深奧的語言是一個挑戰，但我喜歡瞭解中國豐富的文化、傳統和歷史，更不用說它的美味佳餚！在完成我的語言培訓後，我開始在公共事務處內擔任使館的教育官員。這是我夢寐以求的工作！通過富布賴特交流，我能夠訪問中國的優秀大學來促進美中兩國之間的教育交流。通過我作爲 EducationUSA 中國項目主任的工作，我也能夠爲數以千計正在考慮美國高校的中國學生及其家長提供幫助。讓我深感自豪的是，我們製作了適用於 iOS 和 Android 的免費 EducationUSA 移動應用程序 (<strong><em><a href="https://www.educationusachina.com">EducationUSA</a></em></strong>) 通過&ldquo;留學美國五步曲(<a href="https://www.educationusachina.com/sites/default/files/5_steps.zip">https://www.educationusachina.com/sites/default/files/5_steps.zip</a>)&rdquo;爲學生提供指導 &ndash; 32 個視頻和互動工具就像在你口袋中有個 EducationUSA 顧問一樣。我要感謝我全心投入的中國同事以及他們爲富布賴特和 EducationUSA 項目所做的出色工作。在我擔任教育官員的三年間，我訪問了數十所中國大學以及半數以上的中國省份。作爲教育官員，我把我的工作看作是美中兩國之間的橋樑搭建者。</p>

<p>去年，我開始了在美國大使館的新工作，專注於支持新聞活動和大使館的社交媒體工作。這與我的文化事務工作有很大不同，但再一次，我有使館中最出色的團隊之一每天一起工作。我們的工作觸及數以百萬計的人，而且我知道這很重要。在我目前的職位上，我主要把我的工作看作是爲信使提供支持或是爲有關美中關係的信息傳遞提供便利的人。</p>

<p>正如我的其他外交崗位一樣，我的家人跟我一起來到北京。我最小的兒子出生於 2014 年，他在中國的生活時間已經要比他在美國的生活時間長。我所有的孩子都已經學會說中國話和閱讀中文，我很高興他們已經如此欣然地接受了這樣的經歷。我們已經一起參觀了北京和西安的歷史古蹟，前往美麗的桂林和陽朔旅行，欣賞了上海的大都會魅力。我們真心享受我們在中國這裏的五年時光，明年當我的任命結束時將充滿不捨地離開北京。</p>

<p>Before I became a diplomat 11 years ago, I imagined that it would be a lot like Hollywood movies &ndash; I&rsquo;d have to wear a tuxedo and attend a lot of receptions/cocktails all the time. Fortunately, it is not like that. In fact, the day to day work of a U.S. diplomat is far more interesting than a Hollywood movie could portray. Best of all, it is a career that allows you to bring your family along, which is very important to me personally. My wife and I have five children, three daughters and two sons, and together we have had many adventures raising our children overseas. It has been our privilege to live and work in three very different countries &ndash; Ukraine, Nicaragua and China.</p>
<p>My first assignment or diplomatic posting was in Kyiv, Ukraine, where I served for two years as a Consular officer. I worked in the Non-Immigrant Visa section most of the time, but also had a chance to work on the Immigrant Visa line. Doing visa work is quite exhausting. The work load in Kyiv was much smaller than my consular colleagues have in Beijing, but at the end of an 8-hour day of back to back visa interviews in Russia, Ukrainian or English, I was too tired to do much else. The consular work did give me a window on a country as I would interview farmers, performers, students, businessmen, government officials and Ukrainian relatives of American citizens on a daily basis. My favorite experiences were visiting Ukrainian cities to hold press conferences to discuss visas and the popular visa lottery program, followed by visits to universities or local museums and sampling the local cuisine. Perhaps my most legendary moment as a Consular Officer was issuing the immigrant visa to a Ukrainian woman who was going to marry Mr. Santa Claus, from North Pole, Alaska. My family of three small children enjoyed our vacations where we visited the Crimean beaches, the castles of Western Ukraine, or skied together during the long winter months.</p>
<p>My second posting was in Managua, Nicaragua to serve as the Human Rights Officer and Labor Attach&eacute; for the Embassy. This work was completely different from consular work. My portfolio involved meeting with Nicaraguan labor union leaders, indigenous leaders on Nicaragua&rsquo;s Atlantic coast, politicians, civil society groups and NGOs. Because Nicaragua is a developing country, the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti, traveling around was not easy, especially on the Atlantic coast. On one trip, I had to take a two-hour ride on a &lsquo;ponga&rsquo; boat, which is a small-hauled speedboat designed for the lagoons along Nicaragua&rsquo;s coast line, on the bumpy ocean waves to a remote village, meet with the leaders, then turn around for another two-hour ride back to the port city of Bluefields. I met a lot of courageous Nicaraguan who loved their country and wanted to make it better. When we moved to Nicaragua, my new born son came with us, and we have many memories of taking him to the beaches or swimming pools to escape the heat.</p>
<p>After Nicaragua, I was posted in Beijing, China, but first, I needed to study Chinese for two years! The first year of Chinese study took place at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington, D.C., and the second year in Beijing. Learning such a difficult language as an adult was a challenge, but I loved learning about China&rsquo;s rich culture, traditions and history, not to mention its delicious food! After completing my language training, I started working as the Embassy&rsquo;s Education Officer within the Public Affairs Section. This was my dream job! I was able to visit China&rsquo;s great universities to promote educational exchange between the U.S. and China, through the Fulbright Exchange. I was also able to help thousands of Chinese students and their parents considering U.S. colleges and universities through my work as the Director of the EducationUSA China program. I am very proud of the free EducationUSA mobile app for iOS and Android [<strong><em>LINK</em></strong>] we made to guide students through the &ldquo;5 Steps to U.S. Study&rdquo; &ndash; the 32 videos and interactive tools are like having an EducationUSA advisor in your pocket. I am grateful for my dedicated Chinese colleagues and their outstanding work on both the Fulbright and EducationUSA programs too. During the three years that I was the Education Officer, I visited dozens of Chinese universities and over half of China&rsquo;s provinces. As the Education Officer, I saw my work as a bridge-builder between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>Last year, I started a new job in the U.S. Embassy, focused on supporting press events and the Embassy&rsquo;s Social Media efforts. It is very different from my cultural affairs work, but again, I have one of the best teams within the Embassy to work with each day. Our work reaches millions of people and I know it is important. In my current position, I see my work primarily as someone who supports the messengers or facilitates the delivery of the messages about the U.S. and China relations.</p>
<p>As in my other diplomatic postings, my family came with me to Beijing. My youngest son was born in 2014 and has lived in China longer than he has in the U.S. All of my children have learned to speak and read Chinese, and I am pleased that they have embraced this experience so much. Together, we have visited historical sites in Beijing and Xi&rsquo;an, traveled to beautiful Guilin and Yangshuo, and enjoyed Shanghai&rsquo;s cosmopolitan charms. We have truly enjoyed our five years here in China, and will be sad to leave Beijing next year when my assignment concludes.</p>
